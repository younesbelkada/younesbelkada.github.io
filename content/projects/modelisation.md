### Problem statement

During my first academic project, we focused on how we can represent quantitative and qualitative evoluation of a population in a context of competition, reproduction and mutation. This project was conducted together with the [LCQB lab](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/) at Sorbonne University.

The report of the work (**in French**) can be found [here](/files/report_modelisation.pdf) as well as the poster of the presentation [here](/files/poster.pdf)
