title: Challenge '#1 Brain Tumor classification on Kaggle
weight: 10
---

We decided with my friend [Arthur Zucker](https://arthurzucker.github.io/) to challenge ourselves into this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/overview).
The project looks quite exciting, with a serious and challenging application on a real-wolrd problem. According to the official Kaggle repository: *A malignant tumor in the brain is a life-threatening condition. Known as glioblastoma, it's both the most common form of brain cancer in adults and the one with the worst prognosis, with median survival being less than a year. The presence of a specific genetic sequence in the tumor known as MGMT promoter methylation has been shown to be a favorable prognostic factor and a strong predictor of responsiveness to chemotherapy*. 

# Project overview
