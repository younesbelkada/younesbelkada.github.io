Here in the second lecture we are going to tackle the issue of how to solve an MDP (i.e get the optimal policy $\pi$) given some parameters of the problem.</description></item><item><title>Week 1 - RL Course</title><link>http://example.org/notes/rl1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>younesbelkada@gmail.com (Younes Belkada)</author><guid>http://example.org/notes/rl1/</guid><description>Here is the first personal notes from the Reinforcement Learning course that I have decided to take at the MVA Master&amp;rsquo;s program. The course is quite theoretical and this is challenging for me since I have (almost) zero knowledge on Reinforcement Learning. I have decided to try to explain what I have understood in each lecture in order to assimilate the content of each session.
What is Reinforcement Learning? RL is a family of Machine Learning techniques in order to solve a task that is based on the current and previous states of an agent interacting with an environement.</description></item></channel></rss>
