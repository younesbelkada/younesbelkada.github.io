&lt;/div>This is my first post in 2022! For this year I have decided to learn as much as I can about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and be able to master the notions and techniques around NLP.
Why NLP is so exciting? Natural Language Processing is an application of AI and Deep Learning that allows machines and algorithms understand languages (Natural Language) in order to easily deal with any problems related to text (text classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, etc.</description></item><item><title>'Do pedestrians pay attention?

            </div>Here is my attempt to explain the notions and intuitions behind Imitation Learning with the best of my knowledge. Credits to this very nice blog where I have learned most of the things that I have understood about the concept, and to this website for the image above. Now let&rsquo;s directly dive in.

            </div>We decided with my friend Arthur Zucker to challenge ourselves into this Kaggle competition. The project looks quite exciting, with a serious and challenging application on a real-wolrd problem. According to the official Kaggle repository: A malignant tumor in the brain is a life-threatening condition. Known as glioblastoma, it&rsquo;s both the most common form of brain cancer in adults and the one with the worst prognosis, with median survival being less than a year.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
