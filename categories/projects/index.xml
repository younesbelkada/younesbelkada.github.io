To the best of our knowledge, there are very few studies about this task and there is a lack of labeled dataset for the latest. Eye-contact detection in the context of autonomous driving is extremely challenging and useful. The autonomous agent should change its behavior whenever there is a pedestrian looking at it, or not.</description></item><item><title>A frist approach for steganography using Language Models</title><link>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/stego-ml/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/stego-ml/</guid><description>Introduction This project was conducted upon the EPFL CS-433 course, for a semester project, during the fall semester 2020. This project tries to find a novel approach for steganography applied to text data using Language Models.
What is Steganography ? The principle of Steganography is to hide a secret message inside another message or in an image. These techniques can be used to avoid Man In the Middle (MITM) attacks and send secret messages to a pre-defined receiver.</description></item><item><title>An approach for fitness exercise scoring using Deep Learning</title><link>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/pose-socring/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 20:26:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/pose-socring/</guid><description>Introduction Imagine a world where (almost) everything is powered by Artificial Intelligence. Today, some signs of an Artifical Intelligence-guided society are coming into existence. Autonomous cars can automately drive you from a point A to a point B, and more recently, Tesla has revealed the Tesla Bot, the humanoid robot that will be able to help humans for simple tasks.
Apart from having society full of AI-powered robots, back in 2019 when we have starting the project together with my teammates and the laboratory ISIR from Sobonne University, we just wanted to try to tackle to problematic of having an AI-based gym trainer for fitness exercises.</description></item><item><title>An unsupervised method for table structure recognition</title><link>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/table-structure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2019 20:26:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/table-structure/</guid><description>Problem statement Some organizations still use huge amounts of scanned tables / invoices. Rather than manually typing the contents of the tables into an excel file, one can think of using Deep Learning to tackle this problem. Once you identify the distinguishable cells on the tables, we can pass an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to each cell to read its contents and convert it to an excel file for example.</description></item><item><title>Mathematic Modelling of Natural Selection phenomena</title><link>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/modelisation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 20:26:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/modelisation/</guid><description>Problem statement During my first academic project, we focused on how we can represent quantitative and qualitative evoluation of a population in a context of competition, reproduction and mutation. This project was conducted together with the LCQB lab at Sorbonne University.
