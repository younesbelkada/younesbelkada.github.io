What is Steganography ? The principle of Steganography is to hide a secret message inside another message or in an image. These techniques can be used to avoid Man In the Middle (MITM) attacks and send secret messages to a pre-defined receiver.
In practice, such protocols need to follow a golden rule:</description></item><item><title>An approach for fitness exercise scoring using Deep Learning</title><link>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/pose-socring/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 20:26:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/pose-socring/</guid><description/></item><item><title>An unsupervised method for table structure recognition</title><link>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/table-structure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2019 20:26:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/table-structure/</guid><description>Problem statement Some organizations still use huge amounts of scanned tables / invoices. Rather than manually typing the contents of the tables into an excel file, one can think of using Deep Learning to tackle this problem. Once you identify the distinguishable cells on the tables, we can pass an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to each cell to read its contents and convert it to an excel file for example.</description></item><item><title>Mathematic Modelling of Natural Selection phenomena</title><link>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/modelisation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 20:26:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://younesbelkada.github.io/projects/modelisation/</guid><description>Problem statement During my first academic project, we focused on how we can represent quantitative and qualitative evoluation of a population in a context of competition, reproduction and mutation. This project was conducted together with the LCQB lab at Sorbonne University.

Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description></item></channel></rss>
